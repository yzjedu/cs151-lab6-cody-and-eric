I was supposed to learn how to use functions to revise our ATM program from Lab 5.
We first made the algorithm of the 5 different functions to do this, and one of the funnctions used
as the main. We then called the remaining 4 functions in the algorithm of the main one.
Yes our results matched what we were supposed to get, and the error cases are right.
The program works even with extreme test cases.
At first it was difficult to make the while loops inside of the definitions, and it took
a lot of trial and error to make it work properly.
First we designed the algorithm, then we wrote the code, and then tested the code
to make sure it worked properly. I think I learned what I was supposed to in this lab because
now I have a better understanding on how functions work. Working with Eric was nice, very productive.
